The light of my life, she is an angel.
When we adopted her she had trouble adjusting to her new food and was quite stinky as a result. This is where she got her name, from the FRIENDS song "Smelly Cat" by Phoebe Buffet
She is the smartest pet we have, and she is digified and sweet. 
She likes hanging out in the same area as us, but only likes cuddling with my dad.
She is the perfect cat, and we got Peanut hoping she would have the same temperment.
I love her a lot, and even her messes don't make me love her less.
