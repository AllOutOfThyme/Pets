She's a small cat, hence her name.
I would almost call her a baby but she's too evil for that. 
I think she's a siamese mix, and she has the personality to show.
She can be a bit of a brat sometimes, and hates being picked up, but I love her.
She loves cuddling and laying on my lap, and always tries to eat her fur when I brush her.
She dislikes the dogs and tries to hunt them, and usually tolerates Phoebe (when she isn't chasing and tormenting her at least)
