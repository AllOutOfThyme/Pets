___
Richard is a fish, and the only fish I will mention by name.
He's very pretty, and also a cold-blooded killer responsible for the deaths of two other fish.
He's the reason we have fish jail, and to date he has been it's only inhabitant. He served several weeks in total before his release, and he is at high risk of reoffending
His siblings are nicer, but he is prettier.
I think he is a wagtail platy, and other fish include tetras and dwarf gourami.
